# Course Overview
Introduction to Biostatistics provides an introductory overview of selected important topics in biostatistical concepts and reasoning. This course represents an introduction to the field and provides a survey of data and data types. Specific topics include tools for describing central tendency and variability in data; methods for performing inference on population means and proportions via sample data; statistical hypothesis testing and its application to group comparisons; issues of power and sample size in study designs; and random sample and other study types.  Course work includes statistical analysis using the computer, homework assignments, case studies using demo datasets, and a final course project presenting results of analysis of biological data. 
# Course Objectives
Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:
1)	Recognize and give examples of different types of data arising from Biological context (including public health and clinical studies)
2)	Interpret differences in data distributions via visual displays
3)	Calculate standard normal scores and resulting probabilities
4)	Calculate and interpret confidence intervals for population means and proportions
5)	Interpret and explain a p-value
6)	Perform a two-sample t-test and interpret the results; calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means
7)	Select an appropriate test for comparing two populations on a continuous measure, when the two-sample t-test is not appropriate
8)	Understand and interpret results from Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), a technique used to compare means amongst more than two independent populations
9)	Choose an appropriate method for comparing proportions between two groups; construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions
10)	Describe different types of studies
11)	Understand confounding and interaction in studies
12)	Apply the use of R-Studio and advanced Excel concepts to manipulate data and explore trends from a given dataset
